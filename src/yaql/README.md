# YAQL - YAML Advanced Query Language

This is just a placeholder for now.  

The idea is to use the YASL schema to dynamically create a database schema and populate the database with YASL file data enabling standard SQL access.  
This should also allow data to be exported back to YAML based on the YASL schema for storage in a version control system.

In addition to offering "live" DB access, we may also create a YAML schema for queries that could be run in an repeatable manner (i.e. within a CI/CD pipeline).
